About the Project
-----------------

LSTM-based language models have emerged as powerful tools for various applications including text generation, speech recognition, and translation. This project aims to harness this capability to generate novel text sequences inspired by "Romeo and Juliet".

Getting Started
---------------

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Installation:
1. Clone the repo:
git clone (https://github.com/plengxvi/romeonjuliet_lstm_text_gen)

2. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

1. Ensure your dataset (Romeo-Juliet.txt) is in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
python main_script.py
3. Interact with the chatbot and enjoy!
